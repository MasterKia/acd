<h1>Why ACD?</h1>
<h4>Easy to answer. First of all, say goodbye to watching those online classes that you missed or if you want to rewatch them for your exams. It helps you to download and extract all voice and video datas automatically. Add 5 sessions, make a cup of coffee and rest. It will make them ready for you. As easy as a couple of clicks.</h4>
<h4>Also by multithreading I could make it possible to save much more time in downloading and data extraction .</h4>
<h1 id="usage">USAGE</h1>

<h3 id="do-not-close-the-cmd-window">DO NOT CLOSE THE CMD WINDOW</h3>
<p>7 - After launching it, it will open up file dialogue, please choose “acd_sengine.acde” file.
</p>
<p>8 - After loading the app, in Stage-1, click on first item and in the opened dialogue , locate to where you extracted FFMPEG and go into “bin” folder of FFMPEG and the select it. (The bin folder should be empty)</p>
<p>9 - Close the app and launch it again.</p>
<p>10 - Open the app again and in Stage-1, click on the second item, then locate and open “database.acddb” file.</p>
<h2 id="login-into-system">Login into system</h2>
<p>After Stage-1 (it’s a one time thing), Stage-2 is now enabled for you. Select your university or school LMS link (if it’s not in the list, tell me in <a href="https://github.com/soroushamdg/acd/issues">request page</a> by “request school” label).<br>

<p>If login in Stage-2 was successful, now Stage-3 will be become enabled for you. Click on + button next to list and enter you session link in it ( your session link is which is saved on your universities panel page ).<br>

<p>After your download got finished, it will extract files.<br>
To save time I made the app to be multithreaded. While extracting downloaded files , it will download your next file. So in some point your computers performance may drop.</p>
<h2 id="after-stage-3">After Stage-3</h2>
<p>Your downloaded and extracted files will be saved in “exports” folder in your DESKTOP.<br>

<h3> How to update the database? </h3>
Just download the latest version of the database, then copy and replace it with the old one. As simple as that.
<br>
 <h4> most of issues will go away by deleting setting's file and relaunching the app.
to delete settings file.<br>
